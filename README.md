## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Milo, and I am a mechanical and mechatronic student at UTS. I am interested in all things robotics and looking to improve my skills in python, and C++!

- :black_square_button: I recently built an autonomous chess system where a UR3e robotic arm and RG2 gripper play chess against a human opponent. Check it our [here!](https://github.com/miloboyd/chess-robot)

- ðŸ¤– Iâ€™m currently working on further modifications to the chess robot, to reduce path planning time and streamline the robots motion. On the horizon, I'm looking to develop a large scale quadrapet from 3d printed material. 

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to improve my skils in C++, python, Git and linux environment. 

- ðŸ“« If you would like to reach me, my email is: milocb123@gmail.com
